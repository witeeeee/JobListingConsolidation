# Job Listing Consolidation and Categorization

This project aims to create a website/web application that serves as a job listing aggregator, in that it displays job listings based on search parameters and filters from multiple pre-existing job recruitment platforms like LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, Naukri.com, etc. 

There are three main objectives to this project. First, to “cast the widest net”, so to speak, and scrape a large number of job listings along with attributes that are associated with each listing, such as Company Name, Location, Job Type (full-time, part-time, etc.). 
Second, to derive meaningful information out of the collected attributes using machine learning concepts such as classification algorithms, to gauge the skill level of a job, the industry of each job, the responsibilities of the applicant, etc. This stage is especially important, as one of the major challenges that this project aims to solve is that each job posting website displays different attributes, and each listing can also be missing certain information on their own. 
Third, to provide a simple and intuitive user interface with relevant input fields for a job seeker to be able to enter their preferences and view all the job listings that fall under their criteria.
