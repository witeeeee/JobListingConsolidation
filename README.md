# Job Listing Consolidation and Recommendation System

This project aims to create a job aggregation and recommendation system that is both broader and smarter than conventional and simple approaches to creating a recommendation system. We aim to achieve this using a combination of web mining concepts like web scraping and data analytics concepts like recommendation systems. In the end, a user is recommended job listings from multiple sources based on their interests and the profile that they build. 

The job industry is at a particularly fragile place right now due to current economic conditions and the emergence and rapid improvement of new computer technologies like AI, which can cause an even larger shortage of jobs. For this purpose, it is important for there to be a reliable system which is able to simplify the job seeking process as much as possible to reduce the barrier to entry for job seekers, and hence allowing more employment. This project implements improvements to recommendation systems that should allow for more relevant recommendations to be served to job seekers. 

Modules of this project: Web scraping, Classification (Naive Bayes) and Recommendation Systems (Content based and Collaborative filtering together forming a hybrid model)
